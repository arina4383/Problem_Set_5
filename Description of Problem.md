# Problem_Set_5

To get started, download the ps6.zip file. Extract it to your working directory. The files inside are:

ps6.py - a file containing three classes that we will have to implement.
words.txt - a file containing valid English words (should be in the same folder as your ps6..py file).
story.txt - a file containing an encrypted message that you will have to decode (should be in the same folder as your ps6..py file).
